### **Django by Example - Learning Projects**

This repository contains the code and projects built while learning Django through the book *"Django by Example"* by Antonio Mele. The goal of this repository is to track my progress as I work through the book and implement real-world web applications using the Django framework.

### **What’s Inside:**

* **Projects:** Each project in this repository corresponds to a specific chapter or concept from the book, focusing on building practical web applications.
* **Code Examples:** Examples of Django best practices, including models, views, templates, and deployment.
* **Learning Journey:** As I progress, I’ll update this repository with new projects, notes, and improvements to the code.

### **Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Django
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* PostgreSQL (or other databases as needed)

### **Goal:**

To master Django by building hands-on projects and learning by doing. This repository will serve as a portfolio of my learning, and I will continue to improve and expand the codebase as I work through the book.
